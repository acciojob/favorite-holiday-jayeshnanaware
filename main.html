	<h1>Raigad Fort</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Raigad Fort, often called the “Gibraltar of the East,” is one of Maharashtra’s most iconic hill forts and the former capital of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s Maratha Empire. Built between 1656 and 1674 under the supervision of architect Hiroji Indulkar, the fort stands majestically at an altitude of about 2,700 feet in the Sahyadri mountain ranges. It was here that Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as Chhatrapati in 1674, marking the rise of the Maratha sovereignty. Spread across nearly 1,200 acres, Raigad Fort is renowned for its strategic design, strong basalt walls, and panoramic views of lush valleys. The fort once housed royal palaces, administrative buildings, and marketplaces, symbolizing Maratha power and independence. Today, it remains a treasured heritage site, attracting history enthusiasts and trekkers who wish to walk through the legacy of valor and vision that shaped India’s history.
